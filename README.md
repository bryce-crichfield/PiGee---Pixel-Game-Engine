# Pixel Game Engine

This is a side project that I had been developing for about 2 months over the summer of 2021.  

The primary goal for me in the development of this project was to concretize my understanding of object-oriented design principles and patterns.

I also wanted to experiment with the implementation of a model view controller architecture which would allow for the quick development of UI components.  
The engine itself it largely complete, however; no actual game has yet been developed.

Future Goals:
- implemenation of an internal DSL for UI development
- implementation of binding mechanics for interaction between game objects
- further development over game state serialization
